            <p>
                Pianist, harpsichordist, and conductor Suzanne Cartreine founded Turkey Hill Ragtime Orchestra in 2022.
                Combining a lifetime love of ragtime with an academic interest in historical performance practice, she
                was intrigued to discover the repertoire of orchestral arrangements of well-known and little-known rags,
                and excited to hear and play them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Suzie is the Music Director for Tufts University Chaplaincy, where she founded and directs an interfaith
                community choir, Voices for Peace and Light, made up of students, staff, faculty, alum, and community
                members. Additionally, she is the Director of Music at the Unitarian Universalist Society of Wellesley
                Hills.
            </p>
            <p>
                Suzie has a DMus in Historical Performance from Boston University, a MMus in Piano Performance from
                Temple University (Pi Kappa Lambda), and a BA in Physics from Macalester College (Phi Beta Kappa, summa
                cum laude). When not making music, Suzie enjoys yoga, swimming, playing cards, and spending time with
                her husband and two sons.
