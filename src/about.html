        <small>Founder and Director</small>
        <p>
            Pianist, harpsichordist, and conductor Suzanne Cartreine founded Turkey Hill Ragtime Orchestra in 2022.
            Combining a lifetime love of ragtime with an academic interest in historical performance practice, she was
            intrigued to discover the repertoire of orchestral arrangements of well-known and little-known rags, and
            excited to hear and play them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Suzie is the Music Director for Tufts University Chaplaincy, where she founded and directs an interfaith
            community choir, Voices for Peace and Light, made up of students, staff, faculty, alum, and community
            members. Additionally, she is the Director of Music at the Unitarian Universalist Society of Wellesley
            Hills.
        </p>
        <p>
            Suzie has a DMus in Historical Performance from Boston University, a MMus in Piano Performance from Temple
            University (Pi Kappa Lambda), and a BA in Physics from Macalester College (Phi Beta Kappa, summa cum laude).
            When not making music, Suzie enjoys yoga, swimming, playing cards, and spending time with her husband and
            two sons.
